## Definition
- 
- Linear combination: is a multiplication of a scalar to a variable and addition of those terms
- The "span" of vector v and w is the set of all their linear combinations: av + bw
- Linear Dependent: when one vector can be defined as a linear combination of the other vectors, they are a set of linearly dependent vectors
- Linear Independent: when each vector in a set of vectors vector can not be defined as a linear combination of the other vectors, they are a set of linearly independent vectors
- The basic of a vector space is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the full space
